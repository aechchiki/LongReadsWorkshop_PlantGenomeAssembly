In order to have reads which are chromosome "exclusive", we already generated  chromosome 4 read sub-sets.
If time allows it later we will repeat the sub-setting of chromosomal reads ourself.

The following steps have been already executed and are **[described here in detail](documentation/preAssembly.md)**:

 - convert RAW data in a suitable format
 - map reads onto chromosome 4 (we split it further into 4 regions)
 - filter reads which are suitable
 - subset initial total reads to reads of interest
