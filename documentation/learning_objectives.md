The aim of this practical session is to get your hands on real genomic data (DNA) generated from two long-reads sequencing platforms:

* Oxford Nanopore (ONT) [MinION](https://nanoporetech.com/products/minion)
* Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) [Sequel](http://www.pacb.com/products-and-services/pacbio-systems/sequel/)


At the end of this hands-on session, the participants are expected to have learned:

- current state of the art technology, approaches and caveat in genome assembly assessment
- the pre-assembly steps (reads extraction, read filtering, reads subset)
- to assemble genomic reads into contigs
- to compare the assembled contigs to the reference for the analyzed species
- to evaluate genome completeness (remapping, coverage analysis, BUSCO)
- to predict coding genes (Maker)
- the usage and theory behind the used software
